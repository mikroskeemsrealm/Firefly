# Firefly

## NOTE: this project is in maintenance-only mode

So no new features will be added (except if someone PRs them - even then you should honestly consider contributing to [Velocity](https://github.com/VelocityPowered/Velocity)). At most I will fix critical issues, or upstream changes
what automatic merge script is unable to handle.
